# World Happiness Analysis üåçüòä

An exploratory data analysis of the World Happiness Report focusing on the relationship between economic status and happiness across nations.

## About The Project

### Project Goal
To analyze the World Happiness Report dataset to understand the factors contributing to happiness, specifically focusing on how happiness levels vary across countries with different economic statuses. The aim is to highlight that wealth (GDP per capita) is not the sole determinant of happiness and to identify other significant factors.

### Storyline: "Unequal Happiness: Rich, Poor & Outliers"
This narrative explores the relationship between a country's economic status (GDP per capita) and its happiness score, identifying countries that defy the expected pattern (i.e., happy but poor, or rich but unhappy) and uncovering the underlying factors that explain these "outliers."

### Key Research Questions
1. How strong is the relationship between GDP per capita and the Happiness Score?
   - Establishing the baseline expectation between wealth and happiness

2. Which countries are "happy outliers"?
   - Identifying nations with lower GDP but surprisingly high happiness scores
   - Understanding the factors contributing to their well-being

3. Which countries are "unhappy outliers"?
   - Analyzing nations with high GDP but relatively lower happiness scores
   - Exploring factors that might explain their discontent

4. Beyond GDP, which other factors show the strongest correlation with happiness?
   - Examining the role of social support, freedom, healthy life expectancy
   - Analyzing the impact of generosity and perceptions of corruption
   - Special focus on these factors in the context of outlier countries
